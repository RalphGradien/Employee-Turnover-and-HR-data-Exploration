# Employee-Turnover-and-HR-data-Exploration

## Project Overview

The project aims to understand factors contributing to employee turnover and create a predictive model to identify employees at risk of leaving the company.

## OSEMN Data Science Pipeline

1. **Obtaining the Data:**
   - Downloaded the dataset from Kaggle.
   - Imported the data into the working environment.

2. **Scrubbing the Data:**
   - Checked for missing values (dataset was clean).
   - Examined the dataset for readability and appropriate feature names.
   - Converted categorical features (department, salary) to numeric types.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conducted statistical overview and summary.
   - Explored correlations among features using a correlation matrix and heatmap.
   - Analyzed turnover patterns in relation to department, salary, promotion, years at the company, project count, evaluation, average monthly hours, etc.

4. **Modeling the Data:**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Implemented various machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, kNN, Random Forest).
   - Evaluated model performance using training and testing scores.

5. **Interpreting the Data:**
   - Summarized findings from EDA.
   - Highlighted trends related to turnover, satisfaction, salary, project count, and evaluations.
   - Raised questions for further consideration about the impact of losing employees and factors affecting satisfaction and turnover.

## Conclusion and Questions

- Noted trends related to working hours, salary, promotion, and project count.
- Highlighted correlations between turnover, satisfaction, and salary.
- Posed questions about the impact of losing employees and factors influencing turnover and satisfaction.

Note: The code sections may need to be reformatted and executed in a Python environment for full functionality.
